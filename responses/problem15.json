The subquery `(SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employees)` calculates the highest salary from the 'Employees' table. \n2. The main query uses `MAX(Salary)` and the `WHERE` clause to filter out the highest salary from the table.\n3. By using the `<` operator in the `WHERE` clause, we ensure that we get only those salaries which are less than the maximum salary.\n4. Finally, `AS SecondHighestSalary` is used to"
